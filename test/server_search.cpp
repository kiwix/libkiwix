// 1. Snippets are excluded from the plain-text comparison of actual and

//
// 2. Snippets are checked separately. If a plain-text comparison fails

//    that the actual snippet is a substring of the "expected" snippet
//    (the "..." omitted text markes on the snippet boundaries are taken
//    into account). The implementation of that approach is via the
//    isSubSnippet() function.
//
//    Therefore the "expected" snippets in the test data must be a union of
